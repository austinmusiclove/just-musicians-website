Media slider
    somehow replace restricted videos (error 101 or 150 from yt iframe api) with an image or remove from slider or don't allow them to be added in the first place
    somehow make iframes be ready faster; buffering is not the bottle neck, it is getting to onReady
    video seeking
    swipe on mobile
    somehow check to see if video owner has restricted playback on non youtube websites and notify users when they try to add video; and don't include video in slider if this is the case

    add name aliases so that "bob and" name search in active search results can match "Bob & Tanner" with the alias "Bob and Tanner" or maybe interchange & and and always. idk; maybe as part of keywords and do regular search from active serach instead of name search
    sortable listings in single-collection.php
    password reset: use html api for requesting reset so that user can see the updated message or make the modal open after post is processed so they can see it
    make filter buttons on home page more responsive by altering the UI before request returns (and still replacing after request returns to make sure it is always consistent with what the results are)

Bugs
    listing form: on safari observed by Jac Carson while he was with me in person. Exiting the form after saving draft, browser issues warning that there is unsaved data in the form; could be because things are being updated after htmx returns image data to the form and form fields get programatically updated by alpine. was not able to replicate; he might have older safari. Also experienced save draft hanging. and cropper was really small. and question mark showing in image box on user listings page when listing is draft with no cover image
    fails to get messages when window left open for long time (i think; noticing it fails to get messages sometimes; refresh fixes it)
Quirks
    there are duplicate ids in the filter secions for mobile and desktop; they both get out of band swapped by htmx successfully but could cause other issues; can also just use different ids and out of band swap both
    when you delete a user who is still logged in, if they log out after deletion, log out goes to a confirmation screen
Accessibility
    Need full audit
Testing
    Test specific devices with AWS or other service

        CDN for js, images, files, and pre built HTML

        Code splitting in functions.php
        Locality of behavior through HTML and AlpineJs

    if the listing results are showing the blog landing page insead of search results, likely you need to go to settings->Permalinks and hit save in the wp admin
    no <> allowed in name, description, bio
    allowed youtube link formats to test all in Dietrich Calhoun profile in local host mac mini; find the formats in code where the youtube video id parsing functions are in js and php
    new dev env set up

        need to do settings -> permalinks save to get apis to work
