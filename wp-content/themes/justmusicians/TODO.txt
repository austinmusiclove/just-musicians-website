Back End
    Allow modifying default filters from the theme customizor
Security

Deploy
    when updates go up, it does not update immediately for others; maybe they get new html but not new css or something
    dedicated server
Performance
    first 5 results without second trip to server
    only swap out the filter section that was altered
    reduce size of image retrieved for listings in active search options
    use webp for images
Future
    location filtering
Code structure
    create default options for each filter so that they can be used both on the initial load and on the api side; or maybe put the default option logic into the template part itself
Quirks
    there are duplicate ids in the filter secions for mobile and desktop; they both get out of band swapped by htmx successfully but could cause other issues; can also just use different ids an out of band swap both
Document
    no taxonomy terms with " in them
    if the listing results are showing the blog landing page insead of search results, likely you need to go to settings->Permalinks and hit save in the wp admin
