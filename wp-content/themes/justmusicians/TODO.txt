Milestones
    Safari issues on mobile
        only create webp on front end when cropper window closes
            maybe submit form after closing popup
            handle leaving pop up before initial load of cropper finishes
            handle service worker error
            handle uploading image while another is loading; need specific loader for each image
        need to have a way to scroll on phone over images container when they can also be dragged; if there is more than 4, you'll drag when you want to scroll

UX
    collections

    bug: sometimes active search options don't come up
    better confirm delete listing dialog
    add name aliases so that "bob and" name search in active search results can match "Bob & Tanner" with the alias "Bob and Tanner" or maybe interchange & and and always. idk; maybe as part of keywords and do regular search from active serach instead of name search
    sortable listings in single-collection.php
    password reset: use html api for requesting reset so that user can see the updated message or make the modal open after post is processed so they can see it
    listing form
        active search for cities
        better looking disabled and spinner state for submit buttons
        upload multiple images at once
        allow adding venue
        scroll preview to section when corresponding input is focused
        disable input until change made or auto save after input
        limit access until you verify email
        make form invite only
        accept stage plots of any shape; some that have been uploaded are too wide for the 4:3
        make click on preview classificaiton like genre open the appropriate tab in the form instead of just going to search opt area in the form

    dedicated server
    spinner for processing image does not spin on safari and i think it is just because safari is siezing up when webp encoding is happening
Bugs
    listing form: on safari observed by Jac Carson while he was with me in person. Exiting the form after saving draft, browser issues warning that there is unsaved data in the form; could be because things are being updated after htmx returns image data to the form and form fields get programatically updated by alpine. was not able to replicate; he might have older safari. Also experienced save draft hanging. and cropper was really small. and question mark showing in image box on user listings page when listing is draft with no cover image
Quirks
    there are duplicate ids in the filter secions for mobile and desktop; they both get out of band swapped by htmx successfully but could cause other issues; can also just use different ids and out of band swap both
    when you delete a user who is still logged in, if they log out after deletion, log out goes to a confirmation screen
Document
    no taxonomy terms with " in them
    if the listing results are showing the blog landing page insead of search results, likely you need to go to settings->Permalinks and hit save in the wp admin
    no <> allowed in name, description, bio
    allowed youtube link formats to test all in Dietrich Calhoun profile in local host mac mini; find the formats in code where the youtube video id parsing functions are in js and php
