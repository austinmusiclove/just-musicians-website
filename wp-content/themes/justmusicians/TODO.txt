Bugs
    listing form: if you go back to create listing page after creating and the thumbnail input is filled, there is no cropped image and submit will be allowed without thumbnail
    listing form: if you choose a file then you hit choose file again but hit cancel, the file clears from the input and since it is required you cannot submit even though there is a cropper displaying and an image in the preview
Quirks
    there are duplicate ids in the filter secions for mobile and desktop; they both get out of band swapped by htmx successfully but could cause other issues; can also just use different ids and out of band swap both
    when you delete a user who is still logged in, if they log out after deletion, log out goes to a confirmation screen
Document
    no taxonomy terms with " in them
    if the listing results are showing the blog landing page insead of search results, likely you need to go to settings->Permalinks and hit save in the wp admin
