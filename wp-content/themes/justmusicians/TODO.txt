Bugs
    listing form: on safari observed by Jac Carson while he was with me in person. Exiting the form after saving draft, browser issues warning that there is unsaved data in the form; could be because things are being updated after htmx returns image data to the form and form fields get programatically updated by alpine. was not able to replicate; he might have older safari. Also experienced save draft hanging. and cropper was really small. and question mark showing in image box on user listings page when listing is draft with no cover image
    fails to get messages when window left open for long time (i think; noticing it fails to get messages sometimes; refresh fixes it)
    weird skipping around when opening conversation; can't scroll to bottom completely, it jumps back up a little. fixed by scrolling to top and getting oldest messages. hard to replicate; happens after sending a message in my deer fellow convo in prod
    messages have issues loading if response doesnt come back before first update poll (tested by sleeping on the initial req and allowing updates to go through and this worked gracefully; also tried throttling in browser to 3G and it works )
Quirks
    there are duplicate ids in the filter secions for mobile and desktop; they both get out of band swapped by htmx successfully but could cause other issues; can also just use different ids and out of band swap both
    when you delete a user who is still logged in, if they log out after deletion, log out goes to a confirmation screen
Accessibility
    *Need full audit
Document

        Locality of behavior through HTML and AlpineJs

    if the listing results are showing the blog landing page insead of search results, likely you need to go to settings->Permalinks and hit save in the wp admin

    allowed youtube link formats to test all in Dietrich Calhoun profile in local host mac mini; find the formats in code where the youtube video id parsing functions are in js and php
    new dev env set up
        need social log in creds
        need to do settings -> permalinks save to get apis to work
        wp config constants
    you can't have a post with a field named the same as a post type; it causes 404
