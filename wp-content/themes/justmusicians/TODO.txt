Data

    Verification
Security
    audit rest api inputs and html api inputs
Performance
    only swap out the filter section that was altered
    reduce size of image retrieved for listings in active search options
Tags/categories to add
    live looper
    background music
    Orchestral
    instruments (pianist, cellist, etc.)
Future
    location filtering
    venues played filter
Code structure
    create default options for each filter so that they can be used both on the initial load and on the api side; or maybe put the default option logic into the template part itself
    tags.php and tags-modal.php have the same preg replace function and it should maybe be a function because they need to match or else it will break
Quirks
    there are duplicate ids in the filter secions for mobile and desktop; they both get out of band swapped by htmx successfully but could cause other issues; can also just use different ids an out of band swap both
