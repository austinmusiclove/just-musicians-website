Devon
    Need icons for bandcamp, tiktok, soundcloud, x, spotify, apple music
    improved skeleton
    Ask Devon about <200b> after descriptions in listing cards
    Fonts 404s
    verified icon
    No search results with personality
    ask if i messed up the filter bar by removing the top class
    is it important to close filters, search bar, and search options on screen resize? I took it out because i had an issue where it was triggering every time the search results changed height of the container
Security
    audit rest api inputs and html api inputs
Performance
    only swap out the filter section that was altered
    reduce size of image retrieved for listings in active search options
Tags/categories to add
    live looper
    background music
    Orchestral
    instruments (pianist, cellist, etc.)
Future
    location filtering
    venues played filter
Code structure
    create default options for each filter so that they can be used both on the initial load and on the api side; or maybe put the default option logic into the template part itself
    tags.php and tags-modal.php have the same preg replace function and it should maybe be a function because they need to match or else it will break
Data
    regenerate content of each post regularly or when they change it so that it includes new taxonomies and description updates so that they will come up in search for those things
Quirks
    there are duplicate ids in the filter secions for mobile and desktop; they both get out of band swapped by htmx successfully but could cause other issues; can also just use different ids an out of band swap both
