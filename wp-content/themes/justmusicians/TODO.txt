UX
    media slider
        mute button
        bug: video keeps playing if you scroll away from video while slide animation is happening
        play button on thumbnail that moves slider to next slide
        pause symbol appear over the video when scroll away to indicate it is paused and not just buffering
        pause if window is not in focus? or when change tab? check fiverr
        remove left or right arrow when there is no more items in that direction
    Category options do not scroll in modal on mobile (probably on both but not enough options to tell yet)

Code structure
    create default options for each filter so that they can be used both on the initial load and on the api side; or maybe put the default option logic into the template part itself
    tags.php and tags-modal.php have the same preg replace function and it should maybe be a function because they need to match or else it will break
Quirks
    there are duplicate ids in the filter secions for mobile and desktop; they both get out of band swapped by htmx successfully but could cause other issues; can also just use different ids an out of band swap both
