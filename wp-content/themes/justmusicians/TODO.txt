        pause symbol appear over the video when scroll away to indicate it is paused and not just buffering
        pause if window is not in focus? or when change tab? check fiverr
        remove left or right arrow when there is no more items in that direction
        pre buffer youtube videos
        make iframe id unique so that it can handle same youtube video on two different listings or even on the same listing
